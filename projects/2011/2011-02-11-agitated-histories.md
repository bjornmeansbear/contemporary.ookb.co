In January 2010, the Contemporary Museum launched an exhibition series to mark the Contemporary's 20th anniversary. These exhibitions feature twenty artists from all over the globe, working in all media, and representing some of the most promising talent in contemporary art. Each Project 20 artist has been selected by one of twenty guest curators, each of whom has played a significant role in shaping the Contemporary Museum's dynamic twenty–year history. Guest curators have included past directors, former curators, and artists who exhibited in Contemporary Museum exhibitions. By inviting the Contemporary's prominent alumni to each select one artist for these exhibitions, Project 20 celebrates the museum's experimental past while looking ahead to the future of contemporary art. 

“Agitated Histories,” the fourth and final part of the Project 20 exhibition series, includes artists selected by Teresita Fernandez, Joseph Grigely, Irene Hofmann, David Reed, Alison Saar, and the Baltimore Development Cooperative.

“Agitated Histories” brings together an international and intergenerational group of artists whose works in a range of media create a dialogue with history. For some of the artists in this exhibition, history is a subject to be challenged and even re-written, while for others it is a source of inspiration and creative energy.

**Rodney McMillian** has created a body of work that re-contextualizes figures and events that have been neglected by history or forgotten with the passage of time. **Geof Oppenheimer** focuses his artistic practice on the language, conventions, and histories of the aesthetics of politics. Works presented here deconstruct and reframe politics’ visual and textual rhetoric. Prominent speeches of the civil rights movement are the source of inspiration for **Mark Tribe** whose public reenactments of influential protests and rallies examine the legacy of political discourse in the 1960s and 1970s. **Lorraine O’Grady** and **Ulrike Müller** explore aspects of personal history and identity. As a first-generation feminist, O’Grady has had a distinguished career addressing such issues as female subjectivity, the African diaspora, and the media’s framing of the African-American subject. Responding to the legacy of the feminist movement, Müller has created a body of work that mines the history of feminism by exploring the slogans, images, and tactics of the generation of women artists who came before her. With a new work that turns its attention to Baltimore and the history of North Avenue, **Michael Cataldi** has created a work that explores past, present, and future development amidst Baltimore’s burgeoning Station North Arts District.
