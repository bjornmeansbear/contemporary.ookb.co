                  <p class="lead">The Contemporary announces the hiring of Lu Zhang as Business Manager.</strong></p>

                  <p>Baltimore, MD&mdash;The Contemporary is pleased to announce the appointment of Lu Zhang as Business Manager. Lu will oversee organizational operations by maintaining office procedures, supervising financial activity, and allocating resources for the museum. The creation of the Business Manager position is a part of The Contemporary&rsquo;s plan to establish a modest staff who will support the organization&rsquo;s operations.</p>

                  <p>As Business Manager, Lu will also play an active role in improving and expanding the organization&rsquo;s infrastructure and operations by establishing administrative protocols, developing institutional best practices, and fundraising.</p>

                  <p>&ldquo;Lu has had a very broad range of experiences&ndash; all of which make her the ideal candidate for this position. We are so excited to welcome her to our team,&rdquo; said Deana Haggag, Director of The Contemporary.</p>

                  <p>&ldquo;A lecture on Fred Wilson&rsquo;s seminal work Mining the Museum was my first semester introduction to the importance of context in art,&rdquo; said Lu. &ldquo;As a student, I appreciated the access to contemporary artists and their work the museum provided. As an artist, I appreciate The Contemporary&rsquo;s return to its roots and original objective to redefine the museum and the context in which art is shown and discussed. In addition to serving the Baltimore community, The Contemporary expands the conversation around art and promotes artists, galleries, arts organizations, and Baltimore City to a broader audience. I&rsquo;m excited to contribute to The Contemporary&rsquo;s re-envisioned mission focused on artists, collaboration and community.&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>&ldquo;We are very fortunate to have Lu join us&ndash; her professional skills and accomplished background will be fantastic assets for the museum as we continue to expand,&rdquo; said Terry Squyres, President of the Board of Trustees of The Contemporary.</p>

                  <p>Prior to joining The Contemporary, Lu Zhang worked for a number of years as Senior Model Designer at a local architecture firm before transitioning to the non-profit sector in her position as Employer Relations Coordinator at MICA&rsquo;s Joseph Meyerhoff Center for Career Development. In addition to her role as Business Manager at The Contemporary, Lu is Managing Editor at Bmoreart.com, a Baltimore based online Arts Journal, as well as an Adjunct Professor at MICA. Lu received her MFA in Painting at the Frank Mohr Institute in the Netherlands and her BFA in General Fine Arts at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). She has exhibited her drawings and installations in the United States and abroad including shows at C. Grimaldis Gallery in Baltimore, Randall Scott Gallery in Washington DC, and The Center for Art and Culture in France. Lu has received a grant from the Maryland State Arts Council for Works on Paper and been awarded The Trawick Prize Young Artist Award.</p>

                  <p class="lead">The Contemporary kicks off <em>CoHosts</em>, its 2014 Speaker Series, with Coco Fusco and Guest Spot at the Baltimore School for the Arts.</strong></p>

                  <p>The Contemporary is pleased to announce that its inaugural 2014 lecture series; <em>CoHosts</em> will be kicked off with New York based interdisciplinary artist Coco Fusco on Monday, January 13th. <em>CoHosts</em>, will be presented at the Baltimore School for the Arts and is cohosted with Guest Spot Gallery. The lecture will take place in the William Donald Schafer Ballroom with a reception in the Clair Zamoiski and Thomas H. Segal Gallery at 6pm and the lecture starting promptly at 7pm.</p>

                  <p>Each lecture for <em>CoHosts</em> is presented in partnership with thirteen local commercial, artist-run, and independent galleries. Each gallery responded to a simple question: <em>Who is the one artist or art professional that you want The Contemporary to bring to Baltimore?</em> Each gallery will cohost a residency for their selected speaker and identify local artists for their respective studio visits.</p>

                  <p>The Contemporary believes that visiting artists play an important role in public understanding and education of contemporary art. Our annual Speaker Series brings internationally-recognized artists, critics, and art professionals to Baltimore to share their practices and inspire, awe, and challenge our home audience. In the spirit of furthering contemporary art dialogue, each speaker also conducts studio visits with local artists.</p>

                  <p>Coco Fusco is a New York-based interdisciplinary artist and writer. She has performed, lectured, exhibited and curated around the world since 1988. She is a recipient of a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship, a 2013 Fulbright Fellowship, a 2012 US Artists Fellowship and a 2003 Herb Alpert Award in the Arts. Fusco’s performances and videos have been presented in two Whitney Biennials (2008 and 1993), BAM’s Next Wave Festival, the Sydney Biennale, The Johannesburg Biennial, The Kwangju Biennale, The Shanghai Biennale, InSite O5, Mercosul, Transmediale, The London International Theatre Festival, VideoBrasil and Performa05. Her works have also been shown at the Tate Liverpool, The Museum of Modern Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona. She is represented by Alexander Gray Associates in New York.</p>

                  <p>Guest Spot is an independently run artist exhibition space in Baltimore, MD. The unique curatorial program focuses on ideas surrounding impermanence and liminal context within a home dwelling. Artists and curators have the opportunity to install work in a mixed use space, thus challenging the singularity of commercial space and exploring the delicate relationship between space and purpose. Invited non-local artists and curators are welcome to stay as a guest during installation, providing opportunities for exchange with the local scene. Guest Spot is located at 1715 N. Calvert Street and is directed by Rod Malin. The gallery is open Saturday from 1pm-4pm and Wednesday from 5pm&ndash;7pm and by appointment.</p>

                  <p>The Contemporary is pleased to announce the appointment of Ginevra Shay as Program Manager. Ginevra will oversee project development, allocate resources, and establish partnerships and collaborations for the museum. The creation of the Program Manager position is a part of The Contemporary&rsquo;s plan to establish a modest staff who will support the organization&rsquo;s operations.</p>

                  <p>In addition to program management, Ginevra will play an active role in improving and expanding the organization&rsquo;s infrastructure and operations by establishing archiving protocols, developing institutional best practices, and fundraising.</p>

                  <p>&ldquo;Ginevra&rsquo;s curatorial background as well as her experience in arts management and community organizing make her the perfect fit for this position. She takes initiative in a capacity that is crucial for our organization right now,&rdquo; said Deana Haggag, Director of The Contemporary. &ldquo;The Contemporary has been a vital and vibrant part of Baltimore for over twenty years,&rdquo; Ginevra said. &ldquo;&hellip; enriching the lives of diverse audiences through responsive, engaging, and innovative programming. I believe in the hard work that the Board of Trustees and Director Deana Haggag have done over the past year. Through their re-envisioning process, The Contemporary has come back with a bright and strong future supported by the ethos that an institution should facilitate an enriching and inspiring environment for their community. I am proud to be part of that effort and excited to explore new territory with the museum as we develop future programming and projects.&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>&ldquo;We are excited to welcome Ginevra to our team&ndash; her commitment to artists and community engagement echo our values at The Contemporary,&rdquo; said Terry Squyres, President of the Board of Trustees of The Contemporary</p>

                  <p>Ginevra Shay joins The Contemporary following her founding of the Current Space Community Darkroom and Photo Program, located in Baltimore, which underlines her commitment to community in the arts.

She was recently invited to participate in the &ldquo;30 Creative Minds Under 30&rdquo; program at Maryland Art Place and was selected to speak at the Society for Photographic Education National Conference in 2014.

                <div class="col-md-8">
                  <p class="lead">Director&rsquo;s Welcome Letter: <strong>And. We&rsquo;re. Live.</strong></p>

                  <p>Hello Friends,</p>
                  <p>It&rsquo;s been an incredible year and I can barely wait to introduce you to the re-envisioned Contemporary.</p>
                  <p>The Board of Trustees and I have spent countless hours taking this museum apart and putting it back together again. We&rsquo;ve spent the entire past year in an intensive listening process that sought counsel from many great minds, community leaders, and cultural producers in Baltimore and beyond. We were interested in exploring how The Contemporary could sustain itself as a leader of arts and culture while constantly broadening the ideas of audience and engagement.</p>
                  <p>Our deep listening left us with some of the best and most challenging advice we could have ever expected&mdash;we were told to be <em>nimble</em>, <em>responsive</em>, <em>thoughtful</em>, and <em>socially responsible</em>. Our conversations made it perfectly clear that Baltimore needed us to be in service of and for local artists while also sampling national and international contemporary art trends and discourses. Our discussions confirmed that we needed to bring new and diverse audiences to the arts in order to have more robust and meaningful interactions. Our research ultimately brought us back to 1989 and the bar The Contemporary originally set when it was first founded to expand on the idea of a museum.</p>
                  <p>The Contemporary is now a nomadic, non-collecting museum that dedicates its resources to commissioning site-specific and subject-oriented projects that engage diverse audiences and advance contemporary art and culture. Our work is inspired by three guiding principles: <strong>artists matter, collaboration is key, and audience is everywhere.</strong></p>
                  <p>I am excited to announce the appointment of our inaugural <a href="projects.html#council">Curatorial Advisory Council</a>&mdash;a committee of national leaders in the arts that will guide and advise our projects and future programming. We are honored to have Elissa Blount-Moorhead, Emily Blumenthal, Thom Collins, Tom Finkelpearl, Rick Lowe, and Shamim M. Momin on our team. They&rsquo;re immeasurably impressive and between the six of them they have launched many arts non-profits, published extensively, been appointed by the Obama administration to serve on the National Council of the Arts, and even directed The Contemporary in the past!</p>
                  <p>We will also be launching an annual <a href="speakerseries.html">Speaker Series</a>&mdash;each year the venue and theme will change. In the spirit of furthering contemporary art education and fostering meaningful connections, each and every speaker will also conduct studio visits with local artists. Our 2014 Speaker Series, CoHosts, was organized in collaboration with 13 local galleries and will be held at the Baltimore School for the Arts. We prompted each gallery with one simple question: <em>who is the one artist you want The Contemporary to bring to Baltimore?</em> Our first engagement is Coco Fusco, a New-York based visual and performance artist, whose lecture is being cohosted by Guest Spot gallery on January 13th. Our following lectures are from artists Nick Cave (cohosted by Pinebox Art Center) , Brendan Fowler (cohosted by Nudashank), and Wayne White (cohosted by Gallery CA).</p>
                  <p>Our next steps are to announce our first project opening in 2014, expand our Past Projects archive so that everyone can have access to our robust twenty-four year history, and continue organizing the lectures for <em>CoHosts</em>. Ladies and gentlemen, the future of The Contemporary is looking brighter than ever. Thank you for helping us get to where we are. I can&rsquo;t wait to see you on January 13th!</p>
                  <p>Here&rsquo;s to you,</p>
                  <p>Deana Haggag<br/>
                    Director</p>
