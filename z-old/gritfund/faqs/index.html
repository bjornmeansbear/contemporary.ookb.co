                <h2>FAQ’s</h2>

                <h5>What do you mean by collaborative?</h5>
                <p>
                  Collaborative projects present the creative contributions of more than one author. Projects can take many forms. Examples include exhibitions presenting the works of multiple artists, web-based projects with multiple contributors, publications with several writers, a series of exhibitions / publications / screenings / lectures / prints each featuring a different artist, etc.
                </p>



                <h5>What types of projects does Grit Fund support?</h5>
                <p>
                  Grit Fund supports a wide range of artist-initiated collaborative projects that showcase the work of more than one artist, are unlikely to be funded otherwise, and engage the public. Funded activities include exhibitions, publications, public events, public art, film screenings, lecture series, artist residencies, the ongoing work of an existing arts venue or collective, the founding of a new arts venue or collective, and more. Please refer to our eligibility requirements and funding priorities.
                </p>



                <h5>What types of projects will not be funded?</h5>
                <p>
                  Projects proposed by artists outside of Baltimore City or Baltimore County, projects proposed by an individual artist to present their own work, projects that are a part of a registered 501(c)(3) non profit organization’s programming, projects proposed by students, and projects that do not have a public component will not receive funding. Please refer to our eligibility requirements and funding priorities.
                </p>



                <h5>I know the fund only supports collaborative projects, but I think my project should be considered because it is highly participatory and involves the audience directly. Can I apply?</h5>
                <p>
                  It is unlikely that your project will be considered. The jury may review a proposal from an individual artist seeking to present their own work if they present a strong argument for active audience participation that verges on the collaborative.
                </p>



                <h5>Does the Grit Fund support work outside of the visual arts?</h5>
                <p>
                  While the Grit Fund supports interdisciplinary practices, projects should be strongly connected to the visual arts. Performing or media arts are eligible when visual art is a key component of the finished project.
                </p>



                <h5>While my group is not a 501(c)3, nonprofit organization, I want to present my work in a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization’s space and use their facilities. Is my project still eligible for funding?</h5>
                <p>
                  Only artist initiated projects are eligible for funding. Working with a nonprofit, such as the use of their facilities for a performance or event does not necessarily mean your project is not eligible for funding. However, the Grit Fund is not intended to cover production costs that should be covered by an established organization as a part of their regular program.
                </p>



                <h5>Can I apply for a grant to acquire equipment?</h5>
                <p>
                  Equipment purchase or rental can be included as an expense as a part of a larger project. You may not apply for a grant with the sole purpose of acquiring equipment.
                </p>



                <h5>Can I apply to fund general operating for a new or existing art space?</h5>
                <p>
                  Yes. Examples of general operating costs associated with the launch of a new arts space or the support of an existing arts space include: rent, utilities, artist and designer fees, materials and supplies, and promotional materials.
                </p>



                <h5>Can I include artist fees in my budget?</h5>
                <p>
                  Yes, include artist fees in your budget to compensate participants, collaborators, and/or yourself.
                </p>



                <h5>Do we need to have a confirmed venue to submit an application?</h5>
                <p>
                  No. However, if a specific venue or site is crucial to the realization of your project, having a confirmed venue speaks to the feasibility of your project. If you do not have a confirmed venue, describe the types of venues suitable for the presentation of your project, and how you plan to research and secure a venue. Be as specific as possible.
                </p>



                <h5>Who should be listed as the lead organizer?</h5>
                <p>
                  The lead organizer will be the primary contact for the project during the application and granting process. The lead organizer will also be responsible for any taxes on the award. Additionally, the lead organizer must reside in Baltimore City or Baltimore County and cannot be a student at the time of application or during the granting period.
                </p>



                <h5>Please elaborate on the roles of the lead organizer, collaborators, and participants.</h5>
                <p>
                  The lead organizer is the primary contact for the project. Lead organizers and collaborators envision, organize, and implement the project. Participants do not play an administrative role. An artist who is supported by the project (i.e., their work will be presented) but does not play an organizing role is considered a participant.
                </p>



                <h5>Can I apply as a lead organizer without listing other collaborators?</h5>
                <p>
                  You can apply as an individual provided your project serves as a platform for other artists to exhibit, publicly present, or publish their work, etc.
                </p>



                <h5>Do you have to be a U.S. citizen to apply?</h5>
                <p>No. However, the lead organizer must have a social security number in order to receive payment of the award.</p>



                <h5>How much funding can I request for my project?</h5>
                <p>You may request any amount between $1000 and $6000.</p>



                <h5>Will our application be more competitive if we apply for less funding or if we apply for the maximum amount?</h5>
                <p>
                  The amount of funding you request should accurately reflect the goals and logistics of your project. Whether you request the minimum ($1000) or maximum ($6000) level of support is not a factor in the selection process. Supported projects are chosen for their artistic strength, feasibility, and public interface.
                </p>



                <h5>Do I need to secure matching funds?</h5>
                <p>
                  No. The <em>Grit Fund</em> does not require matching funds. Please note in your budget any in-kind donations and additional funding you have already secured. Any requests to support projects that still require funding from other unconfirmed sources may be seen by the jury as less feasible. It is important to scale your project appropriately to the amount you request from the <em>Grit Fund</em>.
                </p>



                <h5>How will the award payment be disbursed?</h5>
                <p>
                  A check will be made out to the lead organizer who will be responsible for any taxes on the award.
                </p>



                <h5>What is the tax obligation if I receive a grant?</h5>
                <p>
                  Grant monies are subject to taxes. We are not able to provide tax advice. If you have questions regarding tax requirements, please seek advice from an accountant.
                </p>



                <h5>How can I learn about past funded projects?</h5>
