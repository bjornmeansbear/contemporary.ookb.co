All Individual Members are eligible for studio visits with our visiting artists, critics, curators, and colleagues. We invite dozens of distinguished arts professionals to Baltimore every year and give them access to our Member Database to select their desired visits, in efforts to build continued dialogue, networking opportunities, and create discourse between our local constituency and the global arts community.
