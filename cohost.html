                      <h1>Coco Fusco</h2>
                      <p>Coco Fusco is a New York-based interdisciplinary artist and writer. She has performed, lectured, exhibited and curated around the world since 1988. She is a recipient of a 2013 Guggenheim Fellowship, a 2013 Fulbright Fellowship, a 2012 US Artists Fellowship and a 2003 Herb Alpert Award in the Arts. Fusco's performances and videos have been presented in two Whitney Biennials (2008 and 1993), BAM’s Next Wave Festival, the Sydney Biennale, The Johannesburg Biennial, The Kwangju Biennale, The Shanghai Biennale, InSite O5, Mercosul, Transmediale, The London International Theatre Festival, VideoBrasil and Performa05. Her works have also been shown at the Tate Liverpool, The Museum of Modern Art, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona. She is represented by Alexander Gray Associates in New York.</p>
                      <p>Fusco's work combines electronic media and performance in a variety of formats, from staged multi-media performances incorporating large scale projections and closed circuit television to live performances streamed to the internet that invite audiences to chart the course of action through chat interaction. Her most recent media installation, And the Sea Will Talk to You (2012), invites audience into the physical and emotional experience of journeying from Cuba by sea. Participants relinquish their worldly possessions before entering a darkened theater where traditional seating has been replaced by the inner tubes that serve as sea crafts for Cuban rafters.</p>
                      <p>Fusco received her B.A. in Semiotics from Brown University (1982), her M.A. in Modern Thought and Literature from Stanford University (1985) and her Ph.D. in Art and Visual Culture from Middlesex University (2007).</p>

                      <p>Guest Spot is an independently run artist exhibition space in Baltimore, MD. The unique curatorial program focuses on ideas surrounding impermanence and liminal context within a home dwelling. Artists and curators have the opportunity to install work in a mixed use space, thus challenging the singularity of commercial space and exploring the delicate relationship between space and purpose. Invited non-local artists and curators are welcome to stay as a guest during installation, providing opportunities for exchange with the local scene. Guest Spot is located at 1715 N. Calvert Street and is directed by Rod Malin. The gallery is open Saturday from 1pm-4pm and Wednesday from 5pm-7pm and by appointment.</p>

                      <h1>Brendan Fowler</h2>
                      <p>In the mid 2000's Brendan Fowler was best known for Barr, his one-person heart on sleeve pop deconstruction / performance art project. He performed in art contexts, galleries and museums, but more so he played in basements and all ages spaces, underground venues, DIY spaces and rock clubs. He released records on Kill Rock Stars and Upset The Rhythm and he toured with Tracy + The Plastics and Xiu Xiu and The Quails and Animal Collective. Since 2007, his output has been mostly dedicated to sculpture and installation, exhibiting in galleries and museums internationally, among them Rivington Arms, Untitled and The New Museum in New York, The Aspen Museum, A Palazzo in Italy, Gallerie Thadeus Ropac in Paris. His photo based sculptures are currently on view in New York as a part of The Museum of Modern Art's New Photography 2013. Describing his turn from performance Fowler says "I wanted to make objects which could function in my absence," and while his work always tends to take full advantage of medium specificities, one can see the links between Fowler's performance and sculptures — both are formalized deconstructions of a very personal narrative. In 2014 Fowler will debut a new body of objects, as well as a new performance guise, And Martin.</p>

                      <h1>Wayne White</h2>
                      <p>Wayne White is an American artist, art director, illustrator, puppeteer, and much, much more. Born and raised in Chattanooga, Wayne has used his memories of the South to create inspired works for film, television, and the fine art world. After graduating from Middle Tennessee State University, Wayne traveled to New York City where he worked as an illustrator for the East Village Eye, New York Times, Raw Magazine, and the Village Voice. In 1986, Wayne became a designer for the hit television show Pee-wee’s Playhouse, and his work was awarded with three Emmys. After traveling to Los Angeles with his wife, Mimi Pond, Wayne continued to work in television and designed sets and characters for shows such as Shining Time Station, Beakman’s World, Riders In The Sky, and Bill & Willis. He also worked in the music video industry, winning Billboard and MTV Music Video Awards as an art director for seminal music videos including The Smashing Pumpkins' 'Tonight, Tonight' and Peter Gabriel's 'Big Time.'</p>
                      <p>More recently, Wayne has had great success as a fine artist and has created paintings and public works that have been shown all over the world. His most successful works have been the world paintings featuring oversized, three-dimensional text painstakingly integrated into vintage landscape reproductions. The message of the paintings is often thought-provoking and almost always humorous, with Wayne pointing a finger at vanity, ego, and his memories of the South. Wayne has also received great praise for several public works he has created recently, including a successful show at Rice University where he built the world’s largest George Jones puppet head for a piece called 'Big Lectric Fan To Keep Me Cool While I Sleep.'</p>
