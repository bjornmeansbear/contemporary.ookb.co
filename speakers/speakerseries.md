title: "2014: Cohosts!"
---

Visiting artists play an important role in public understanding and education of contemporary art. Our annual Speaker Series brings internationally-recognized artists, critics, and art professionals to Baltimore to share their practices and inspire, awe, and challenge our home audience. In the spirit of furthering national/international? art dialogue in Baltimore, each speaker also conducts three to five studio visits with local artists.

The 2014 Speaker Series, Cohosts, will be presented at the Baltimore School for the Arts and co-hosted by thirteen local commercial and artist-run galleries. Each gallery responded to a simple question: “Who is the one artist or art professional that you want The Contemporary to bring to Baltimore?” Each gallery will co-host a residency for their selected speaker and identify local artists for their respective studio visits.

The 2015 Speaker Series, Talking Shop, will partner acclaimed artists and non-arts professionals from various disciplines to discuss the nexus of art with science, technology, politics, and more. Stay tuned for more details!
