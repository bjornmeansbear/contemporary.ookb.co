                    The Contemporary is pleased to announce the inaugural grantees of the Grit Fund. In its first round, the Grit Fund received over 80 applications and awarded $50,000 to 10 projects with grants ranging from $3,200 to $6,000. Awards were determined by a five-person jury of national arts leaders: Roya Amirsoleymani (Portland, OR), Gary Kachadourian (Baltimore, MD), Sharon Louden (Minneapolis, MN), David Mitchell (Baltimore, MD), and José Ruiz (Washington D.C.). The Contemporary would like to congratulate this year’s grantees: Art Royalty Music Video Production & Listening Party; bb: Interdisciplinary Arts Space & Lecture Series; Conversations: A BmoreArt Podcast Series; Exhibitions; Exittheapple Artspace, Capacity Expansion; Hyrsteria; Open Space; Sight Unseen presents New Experimental Works; Skatenight Showcase and Exhibit; and Throwing a Stone.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Grit Fund supports unincorporated and collaborative artist-organized activity that contributes significantly to Baltimore's arts landscape but seldom qualifies for traditional funding. Established with generous support from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the Grit Fund expands Warhol’s Regional Regranting Program to the Mid-Atlantic, encouraging projects that generate opportunities and create platforms for artists to engage with each other and with the public. Funded activities could include but are not limited to: exhibitions, publications, public events, public art, film screenings, the ongoing work of an existing arts venue or collective, and the founding of a new arts venue or collective.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The next Grit Fund round will open on December 8th, 2015.
                  </p>

                    <h3>Art Royalty Music Video Production & Listening Party</h3>
                    <p>
                      <a href="http://tttheartist.com/">Art Royalty</a> Music Video Production & Listening Party by Tedra Wilson, Marquis Gasque, Felipe Goncalves, Jose Rosero, Donald Ely, Marquis Revlon, and Histo; funded $5200; Art Royalty aims to create a truly interdisciplinary space that exists between visual arts, music, and performance by infusing animation and dance into the Baltimore Club, EDM, and Hip Hop scenes. Grit Fund supports the production and presentation of a 3D music video artist expo event that will join many different artists in creating a dynamic collaborative project and help to sustain artistic business relationships. The event will act as the music video premiere for “Pum Pum,” an electro dance inspired record that is all about women expressing their sexual freedom through costume, song, and dance. “Pum Pum” will be an animated video collaboration that incorporates the art of vogue dance with animation. The event will cross several different audiences including a visual arts audience, dance audience, and Baltimore Club audience.

                    <h3>bb: Interdisciplinary Arts Space & Lecture/Talk Show Series</h3>
                    <p>
                      <a href="http://saabgroup.tk/">bb</a>: Interdisciplinary Arts Space & Lecture/Talk Show Series by Alexandra Linn, Colin Alexander, Lucas Haroldsen, Evan Roche, and Harrison Tyler; funded $4400; bb is an artist-run interdisciplinary project space focused on providing free lectures, workshops, and events to the public. The storefront cycles between functioning as a gallery, lecture hall, and social space for ongoing drawing nights, communal meals, and film screenings. Grit Fund supports the completion of bb’s building renovation, archival documentation of events, and a series of lectures and a talk show aimed at highlighting local residents in both arts and non-arts vocations to expand Baltimore’s art community and audience. By providing a platform for local business owners, realtors, and other self-described non-artists to share their stories in an arts context, the lecture series and Talk Show seek to provide a new perspective on topics generally dominated by the same groups of local artists and audiences. Bb’s first lecture of this series featured a demonstration on pasta-making by chef Sandy Smith of nearby restaurant Bottega. Future lectures and talk shows will further the dialogue beyond food and into more geographically specific topics, potentially covering hair-braiding, boxing, running a carryout food business, and owning property in Baltimore.

                    <h3>Conversations: A BmoreArt Podcast Series</h3>
                    <p>
                      Conversations: A BmoreArt Podcast Series by Cara Ober, Jack Livingston, Benjamin Levy, Lauren Van Slyke, Dwayne Butcher, Rebecca Juliette, and Jermaine Bell; funded $5700; <a href="http://bmoreart.com/">BmoreArt</a> is a vital online source for arts coverage and conversation in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Grit Fund allows BmoreArt to enhance coverage through a new bi-weekly series of podcast interviews titled “Conversations”. This new series will feature 26 episodes coordinated by Managing Editor Jack Livingston with a diverse group of artists, curators, collectors, and administrators who have made significant contributions to the arts and culture of Baltimore. By chronicling the lives of these individuals, the podcast will examine their goals, strategies, and struggles in shaping the culture of the region from the past to present. BmoreArt has established a proven record for high quality journalism and is dedicated to creating opportunities for professional growth and exposure for area artists, as well as cultivating relationships between the art community and a larger general audience.

                    <h3>Exhibitions</h3>
                    <p>
                      Exhibitions by Nicholas Wisniewski, Dane Nester, and Matt Papich; funded $5000; “Exhibitions” is the first collaborative work of Nicholas Wisniewski, Dane Nester, and Matt Papich. Grit Fund supports the production of four artist-designed events that subvert the structure of familiar sites of cultural engagement—party, restaurant, concert—and reimagine sterile modes of interaction to produce new, unexpected, and consequential relationships in Baltimore. Investigating familiar sites of cultural engagement often governed by prescribed behaviors and expectations, the project aims to create an alternative, subversive space for social interaction to produce varied relationships with new and different Baltimoreans. “Exhibitions”, which will be hosted at 2239 Kirk Avenue and held at intervals during the course of one year, will deconstruct these familiar social and cultural spaces and the behaviors and expectations that go with them. These multi-sensory gatherings will take new forms—museum-concerts, sound-meals, tactile-observations—that disorient and reorient attendees. Each event will be free and open to the public and collaboratively produced by 4-6 local artists.

                <p class="lead">
                  The Grit Fund, administered by The Contemporary, provides 8-12 grants in amounts between $1,000–$6,000, totaling $50,000 annually. The Grit Fund will accept proposals from non-incorporated, artist-organized initiatives that work collaboratively and reside in Baltimore City or Baltimore County. Projects must take place in either Baltimore City or Baltimore County and be accessible to the general public. The Contemporary’s mission is inspired by three guiding principles: artists matter, collaboration is key, and audience is everywhere. In keeping with this mission, the Grit Fund values risk-taking, encourages collaboration, and seeks to expand points of access to contemporary art. The next Grit Fund round will open on December 8th, 2015.

                <p>
                  <a href="http://www.warholfoundation.org/grant/regranting.html">The Regional Regranting Program</a> aims to support vibrant, under-the-radar artistic activity by partnering with leading cultural institutions in communities across the country. The program allows The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts to reach the sizeable population of informal, non-incorporated artist collectives and to support their alternative gathering spaces, publications, websites, events and other projects. The Foundation plans to expand this program with partner organizations in areas where the level of on-the-ground, self-organized artistic activity is highest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Foundation’s longest running regional regranting program, administered by San Francisco’s Southern Exposure, has been in operation since 2007. With the formation of the <em>Grit Fund</em>, The Contemporary joins eight regranting programs in San Francisco, CA (<a href="https://www.soex.org/alternative-exposure">Southern Exposure’s <em>Alternative Exposure</em></a>); Kansas City, MO (<a href="http://rocketgrants.org/">Charlotte Street Foundation and Spencer Museum of Art’s <em>Rocket Grants</em></a>); Chicago, IL (<a href="http://propellerfund.org/">Threewalls and Gallery 400’s <em>Propeller Fund</em></a>); Houston, TX (<a href="http://www.theideafund.org/">Diverse Works, Aurora Picture Show, and Project Row Houses’ <em>The Idea Fund</em></a>); Portland, OR (<a href="http://pica.org/precipice-fund/home/">Portland Institute for Contemporary Art’s <em>The Precipice Fund</em></a>); Miami, FL (<a href="http://www.wavemakergrants.org/">Cannonball’s <em>Wavemaker Grants</em></a>); Portland, ME (<a href="http://kindlingfund.org/">SPACE Gallery’s <em>The Kindling Fund</em></a>); and New Orleans, LA (<a href="http://platformsfund.org/home/">Press Street, Ashé Cultural Arts Center, and Pelican Bomb’s <em>Platforms Fund</em></a>).
