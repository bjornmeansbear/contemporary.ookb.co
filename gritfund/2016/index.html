                  <p>
                    The Grit Fund supports unincorporated and collaborative artist-organized activity that contributes significantly to Baltimore's arts landscape but seldom qualifies for traditional funding. Established with generous support from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, and bolstered in this round with additional support from the Robert W. Deutsch Foundation, the Grit Fund encourages projects that generate opportunities and create platforms for artists to engage with each other and with the public. Funded activities could include but are not limited to: exhibitions, publications, public events, public art, film screenings, the ongoing work of an existing arts venue or collective, and the founding of a new arts venue or collective.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The next Grit Fund round will open on December 6th, 2016.
                  </p>

                <p class="lead">
                  The Grit Fund, administered by The Contemporary, provides 8-12 grants in amounts between $1,000–$6,000, totaling $50,000 annually. The Grit Fund will accept proposals from non-incorporated, artist-organized initiatives that work collaboratively and reside in Baltimore City or Baltimore County. Projects must take place in either Baltimore City or Baltimore County and be accessible to the general public. The Contemporary’s mission is inspired by three guiding principles: artists matter, collaboration is key, and audience is everywhere. In keeping with this mission, the Grit Fund values risk-taking, encourages collaboration, and seeks to expand points of access to contemporary art. The next Grit Fund round will open on December 6th, 2016.

                <p>
                  <a href="http://www.warholfoundation.org/grant/regranting.html">The Regional Regranting Program</a> aims to support vibrant, under-the-radar artistic activity by partnering with leading cultural institutions in communities across the country. The program allows The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts to reach the sizeable population of informal, non-incorporated artist collectives and to support their alternative gathering spaces, publications, websites, events and other projects. The Foundation plans to expand this program with partner organizations in areas where the level of on-the-ground, self-organized artistic activity is highest.

                <p>
                  The Foundation’s longest running regional regranting program, administered by San Francisco’s Southern Exposure, has been in operation since 2007. With the formation of the <em>Grit Fund</em>, The Contemporary joins eight regranting programs in San Francisco, CA (<a href="https://www.soex.org/alternative-exposure">Southern Exposure’s <em>Alternative Exposure</em></a>); Kansas City, MO (<a href="http://rocketgrants.org/">Charlotte Street Foundation and Spencer Museum of Art’s <em>Rocket Grants</em></a>); Chicago, IL (<a href="http://propellerfund.org/">Threewalls and Gallery 400’s <em>Propeller Fund</em></a>); Houston, TX (<a href="http://www.theideafund.org/">Diverse Works, Aurora Picture Show, and Project Row Houses’ <em>The Idea Fund</em></a>); Portland, OR (<a href="http://pica.org/precipice-fund/home/">Portland Institute for Contemporary Art’s <em>The Precipice Fund</em></a>); Miami, FL (<a href="http://www.wavemakergrants.org/">Cannonball’s <em>Wavemaker Grants</em></a>); Portland, ME (<a href="http://kindlingfund.org/">SPACE Gallery’s <em>The Kindling Fund</em></a>); and New Orleans, LA (<a href="http://platformsfund.org/home/">Press Street, Ashé Cultural Arts Center, and Pelican Bomb’s <em>Platforms Fund</em></a>).
