Stuff to do:

## Homepage
- Email capture form — do something that confirms you've signed up

## Donate
- Finish figuring out how to get rid of form title on donate page

## News
- Build out NEWS page from deana's text

## Mobile
- At ipad/tablet screen width the navbar goes to 2 lines and hides somethings… resolve this as well.

## Bios
- Figure out what to do about text overflowing edges of pages…
- Board w/ titles in separate container; need to make them also close when other bios activate.

- The 'Email List' in footer is not the same on each page.
