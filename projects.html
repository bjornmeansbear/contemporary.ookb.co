                <p class="lead">The Contemporary believes that art belongs in all aspects of society because it is a catalyst for creative thinking and innovation.  We are committed to commissioning site-specific and subject-oriented projects that exist in public space and are in collaboration with other existing, arts and non-arts institutions and organizations.</p>
                <p>We are, at our core, a presenting institution that is invested in working with artists to incubate innovative projects and re-contextualize existing works that speak to many diverse audiences. We believe that contemporary art embodies a tremendous range of identities and we will continue our tradition of working with local, regional, national, and international artists at all stages of their careers. In keeping with our desire to dissolve boundaries, we will expand our programming by reaching out to creative minds in non-arts fields; architects, engineers, philosophers and more will play an important part in our project development and public programming.</p>
                <p>We&rsquo;re forever committed to remaining nimble and forward thinking. <em>We will be announcing our upcoming projects soon</em>.</p>

              <h1>Curatorial Advisory Council.</h1>
              <p>During our re-envisioning, we decided to eliminate the concept of a resident curator. By removing the weight given to a single individual&rsquo;s curatorial preferences and style, The Contemporary was able to create a system as dynamic as our mission. We&rsquo;re excited to have assembled a national team of brilliant minds with diverse creative backgrounds to advise and guide our programming. In this way, collaboration is assured to be the guiding force in all aspects of our methodology.</p>
